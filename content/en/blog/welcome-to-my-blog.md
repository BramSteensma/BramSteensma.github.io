Welcome to My Blog
I’m glad you’re here. This website marks an exciting new chapter for me as I transition from over a decade in IT support and customer service into the world of data analysis and AI. I recently started the Data Analysis and AI Specialist program at Eastern College, and one of our first projects was to build a personal website using Hugo.
I decided to build mine using the CareerCanvas theme by Felipe Cordero to give it a polished, professional feel that reflects where I’m headed.


## Why I Built This Website?

For years, I’ve helped people solve technical problems, improve workflows, and navigate digital tools. Now, as I shift into data analysis, I wanted a space that brings together my background in IT, my growing analytical skill set, and my interest in AI-driven solutions.
Hugo felt like the right choice because:

- **Speed**: Static sites load incredibly fast
- **Simplicity**: Writing in Markdown keeps the focus on content
- **Flexibility**: Easy customization without unnecessary complexity
- **Professional Design**: CareerCanvas gives me a clean, modern foundation

This site is more than a class assignment—it’s a place to document my growth, share what I’m learning, and build a professional presence that reflects my journey


## What You’ll Find Here

As I progress through my program and continue developing my skills, I’ll be sharing insights on:

- **Data Analysis**: MProjects, tools, and techniques I’m learning
- **AI & Machine Learning**: Concepts and practical applications
- **- Process Improvement**: How data and automation can streamline workflows
- **- Professional Growth**: Reflections on transitioning into a new field


## The Tech Behind This Site

This website is built with:

- **Hugo**: For static site generation
- **CareerCanvas**: The theme I chose to support a clean, professional layout
- **GitHub**: For version control and deployment

## Join Me on This Journey

I’ll be writing about:

- Building and maintaining this website
- What I’m learning in the Data Analysis & AI Specialist program
- My hands‑on projects and experiments
- How my IT background shapes my approach to data
- The challenges and wins of shifting into a new career
There’s a lot ahead, and I’m excited to share it. If you’re interested in data, AI, career transitions, or simply following someone’s learning journey, you’re in the right place.
