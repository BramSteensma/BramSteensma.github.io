  Hi, I’m Bram — an IT Support pro with 10+ years of frontline customer service experience and a growing passion for data. I thrive in fast-paced, high-pressure environments and bring strong communication, problem-solving, and follow-through to everything I do.
      
  Currently, I’m leveling up through the Data Analysis & AI Specialist program at Eastern College, turning real-world support experience into sharp analytical skills. My goal? To help businesses make smarter, data-driven decisions that actually make a difference.
